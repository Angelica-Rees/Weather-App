# Weather App

## Overview

This is a weather app made using HTML, CSS, and JS. The weather app will open to a page with the weather in Boston and the user can then enter a different city to get the weather in that particular city. The background image will change to be something according the weather description in that city. The app relies on openweather.org API to retrieve the weather information and unsplash.com to retrieve the random image based on the weather description.
